# The BstMap class is a binary search tree based implementation of
# a map (or dictionary). It works for any type of values and for
# all types keys that are comparable ==> we can compare keys using
# the operators < and >.


# The Node class is responsible for most of the work.
# Each call to the BstMap class is just delegated to the
# root node which starts a recursive sequence of calls to
# handle the request. Notice: All Node methods are recursive.
