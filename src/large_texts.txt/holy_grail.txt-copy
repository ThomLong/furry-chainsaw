youre
using
coconuts
arthur

soldier
youve
got
two
empty
halves
of
coconut
and
youre
bangin
em
together
arthur
so
we
have
ridden
since
the
snows
of
winter
covered
this
land
through
the
kingdom
of
mercea
through--
soldier
whered
you
get
the
coconuts
arthur
we
found
them
soldier
found
them
in
mercea
the
coconuts
tropical
arthur
what
do
you
mean
soldier
well
this
is
temperate
zone
arthur
the
swallow
may
fly
south
with
the
sun
or
the
house
martin
or
the
plover
may
seek
warmer
climes
in
winter
yet
these
are
not
strangers
to
our
land
soldier
are
you
suggesting
coconuts
migrate
arthur
not
at
all
they
could
be
carried
soldier
what
swallow
carrying
coconut
arthur
it
could
grip
it
by
the
husk
soldier
its
not
question
of
where
he
grips
it
its
simple
question
of
weight
ratios
five
ounce
bird
could
not
carry
one
pound
coconut
arthur
well
it
doesnt
matter
will
you
go
and
tell
your
master
that
arthur
from
the
court
of
camelot
is
here
soldier
listen
in
order
to
maintain
air-speed
velocity
swallow
needs
to
beat
its
wings
forty-three
times
every
second
right
arthur
please
soldier
am
right
arthur
im
not
interested
soldier
it
could
be
carried
by
an
african
swallow
soldier
oh
yeah
an
african
swallow
maybe
but
not
european
swallow
thats
my
point

yeah
agree
with
that
arthur
will
you
ask
your
master
if
he
wants
to
join
my
court
at
camelot
soldier
but
then
of
course
a--
african
swallows
are
non-migratory
soldier
oh
yeah
soldier
so
they
couldnt
bring
coconut
back
anyway
clop
clop
clop
soldier
wait
minute
supposing
two
swallows
carried
it
together
soldier
no
theyd
have
to
have
it
on
line
soldier

simple
theyd
just
use
strand
